# Introduction

## Objectives

- Learn how to solve problems

- Learn what computer scientists study

- Understand and analyze some standard algorithms 

- Understand the form and function of various data structures

- Learn how to implement them in Python

- Learn to write bug-free and efficient code

- How to write pseudo-code and analyze them on a whiteboard

## What is a computer?

> A machine that stores and manipulates information under the control of a changeable program.

Can computers do everything?

> Not everything. Things that need infinite steps are not suitable for computers. For example, computers can not represent (without any approximation) the irrational numbers.

## What is computer science

It is not the study of computers!!

> "Computers are to computer science what telescopes are to astronomy." -- E. Dijkstra

- What can be computed?

- How can something be computed? 

    > a recipe of computing something is called an **algorithm**

- Making computations more efficient

## Hardware

## Programming Languages

- Why do we need another language for speaking to computers??
    > our languages are not **precise**

- Computer semantics, on the other hand, are very precise

- Coding the process of writing an algorithm in a programming language

## Do computers really understand a programming language?

> **No!!**

- Computer hardware can only understand a very *low-level* language, known as
**machine language**

- Why not to learn machine language?
    - machine instructions are barely human-readable

    - they are not *portable*
